Certainly, here are the step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the application using a virtual environment for Python 3.7:

1. **Setup Virtual Environment**:
   - Open the terminal.
   - Install the virtual environment package if you haven't already: `conda create -p venv python=3.7 -y`.
   - Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
    conda activate venv/

2. **Download Chromedriver**:
   - Download the appropriate ChromeDriver version for your operating system from the official website(https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
   - Direct link for windows(https://edgedl.me.gvt1.com/edgedl/chrome/chrome-for-testing/120.0.6099.71/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip).
   - Save the ChromeDriver executable in a directory of your choice.

3. **Install Required Modules or Packages**:
   - Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Set Up the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook in your virtual environment.
   - pip install ipykernel
   - pip install jupyter notebook

5. **Run Application.py**:
   -python application.py
 

By following these steps, you can set up a virtual environment, download the ChromeDriver, install neccessary modules which are present in the requirements.txt , and run the `application.py` script in the Jupyter Notebook environment. This process helps ensure a clean and isolated development environment for your application.
